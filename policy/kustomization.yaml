# Each entry in this list should resolve to a directory
# containing a kustomization file, else the
# customization fails.
#
# The entry could be a relative path pointing to a local directory
# or a url pointing to a directory in a remote repo.
# The url should follow hashicorp/go-getter URL format
# https://github.com/hashicorp/go-getter#url-format
#
# The presence of this field means this file (the file
# you a reading) is an _overlay_ that further
# customizes information coming from these _bases_.
#
# Typical use case: a dev, staging and production
# environment that are mostly identical but differing
# crucial ways (image tags, a few server arguments,
# etc. that differ from the common base).
bases:
- ../base

# Each entry in this list results in the creation of
# one Secret resource (it's a generator of n secrets).

  # env is a path to a file to read lines of key=val

# Each entry in this list should resolve to
# a kubernetes object and a JSON patch that will be applied
# to the object.
# The JSON patch is documented at https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6902
#
# target field points to a kubernetes object within the same kustomization
# by the object's group, version, kind, name and namespace.
# path field is a relative file path of a JSON patch file.
# The content in this patch file can be either in JSON format as
#
#  [
#    {"op": "add", "path": "/some/new/path", "value": "value"},
#    {"op": "replace", "path": "/some/existing/path", "value": "new value"}
#  ]
#
# or in YAML format as
#
# - op: add
#   path: /some/new/path
#   value: value
# - op:replace
#   path: /some/existing/path
#   value: new value
